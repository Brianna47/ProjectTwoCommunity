project one brianna de la torre


## project overview

This project was based around written word I needed to find that represents some sort of commmunity. After much thought about what written word could represent something that I feel within a community was tough, until I had remembered about a quote that was created by Orion Carloto for her friends that was used for merch as well. It is titled, did i tell you how i found god in the arms of my friends. It was not until I moved to San Francisco and met the people I have now that I finally felt apart of something, making them my community. The poem goes on to explain how she finds pieces of things that remind her of her dear friends in the little things of her day to day activities or routines which completely explains how I feel about my friends and how they have shaped me to be the person I am today.  


## technical overview 
I have not just yet gotten to the css coding aspect but will utilize animations that make certain letters pop out to hint towards the navigation portion of the site and etc.
